    "**PYTHON INTRODUCTION**  \n",
    "**Python**  is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose dynamic programming language that focuses on code readability ¹². It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991 ¹. Python is widely used in various fields such as web development, data science, machine learning, and more ¹⁵. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python's syntax is designed to be simple and easy to read, making it an ideal language for beginners to learn programming ². Python has a large standard library that provides many useful modules and functions that can be used to perform various tasks ¹. Python also has a vast community of developers who contribute to open-source libraries and frameworks that can be used to build complex applications ¹.\n",

    "**INPUT IN PYTHON**\n",

    "Python has several types of operators that can be used to perform different operations. Here are some of the most commonly used operators in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Arithmetic operators**: These operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric values. Examples include `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `%` (modulus), `**` (exponentiation), and `//` (floor division).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assignment operators**: These operators are used to assign values to variables. Examples include `=` (simple assignment), `+=` (addition assignment), `-=` (subtraction assignment), `*=` (multiplication assignment), `/=` (division assignment), `%=` (modulus assignment), `**=` (exponentiation assignment), and `//=` (floor division assignment).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comparison operators**: These operators are used to compare two values and return a Boolean value (`True` or `False`). Examples include `==` (equal to), `!=` (not equal to), `<` (less than), `>` (greater than), `<=` (less than or equal to), and `>=` (greater than or equal to).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Logical operators**: These operators are used to combine conditional statements and return a Boolean value (`True` or `False`). Examples include `and`, `or`, and `not`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Identity operators**: These operators are used to compare the memory locations of two objects and return a Boolean value (`True` or `False`). Examples include `is` and `is not`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Membership operators**: These operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object and return a Boolean value (`True` or `False`). Examples include `in` and `not in`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Bitwise operators**: These operators are used to perform bitwise operations on binary numbers and return an integer value. Examples include `&` (bitwise AND), `|` (bitwise OR), `^` (bitwise XOR), `~` (bitwise NOT), `<<` (left shift), and `>>` (right shift).\n",
